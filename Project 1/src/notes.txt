scheduler measures the the q and tells dispatcher to remove it from the cpu.

calculate avg run time for 4 processes containing just calculate command and the divide it by 4-8(
to calculate a good quantum time)
Critical section- process should check for wait() or signal();

Things printed:
process names
state
percentage of completion out of all commands.





Get rid of quantum during CS 
When comparing scheduler, see how many processes run within a minute and use the fastest one
Deterministic-Fork in template
Prob-Fork call randomly
child can run any template, can create template to run one or two commands. Need to have cascading
for interrupt, put process to sleep and then resume the same process. randomly
